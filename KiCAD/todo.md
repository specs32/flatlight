TODO

- include 3.3V zener protection from programmer pins to battery
- include deep sleep/wakeup modes in the software routine to
- replace  physical on/off button controlling the dual mosfet softlatch with ÂµC-pin (saves tremendous amount of money !)
- touch library ? (easy but useful ?)(the idea is: to have touch in each corner of the lamp through the magnets in the corners, touch patterns to control, remove all buttons and mold completly in transparent silicon)
ie. touch 3 corners at the same time to power on, slide from one corner to another to controll brightness and so on.
the atmega 16 has a lot of analog pins !!!
- brainstorm other useful sensors ... 3 axis, pressure, accellration ? 
- sound ?
- include boost converter and resistor network for 300mA USB-A charging port (clunky) ?
