# flatlight

__Code for the Flatlight__

Arduino Programm for the Flatlight with an ATMega 8 ÂµController.

- Set the fuses on a new ATMega chip.

- Use the programmer and ISP of your Choice, i usually export as HEX file and flash with avrdude.

I'm nowhere near being a good Programmer, the code works for me although it is not very elegant.
There will be a release of the KiCAD Project in the near future as well as a Video where i build a complete Flatlight, 
so you can see how it is intended to be.
