__What is Flatlight?__


A (relatively) powerful light, that nicely fits into your pockets because it's flat like a phone ;)

This Project is intended for educational and private use. (Probably to show how not to do a few things^^)

I designed the "Flatlight" myself, searching for circuits online, creating the schematics and layout with KiCAD.
I  built a few prototypes from bare copper PCB to the finished device, including printing the transparencys, exposing, developing, etching, cleaning, filing, placing the components and toasting the board on my old camping gas stove.

And as you can see im not much of a programmer ...

I got a lot of positive feedback from everyone, so I thought its time to share ! :)

__Building the Flatlight__

You should find everything you need in the KiCAD Folder to get started Hardwarewise.



__Code for the Flatlight__

It started out as a C++ Project in Eclipse, but i found that pretty difficult to set up and handle, so i switched to arduino.
The Arduino Programm is for the Flatlight .

PS: Thanks and credits to cpldcpu for the nice tiny library which i forked here to adapt it to sk6812 RGBW LEDs!
