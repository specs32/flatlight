The Library can be zipped and imported in Arduino(has to be greater version than 1.0.0) or can be directly copied in the
\Documents\Arduino\libraries\ProLib
directory to update the library you have to delete the old one manually and copy the new files in said directory.

The Library is still WIP and with the given .ino you can just controll the battery LEDs.
(Press/Hold/Release/ShortPress) the "Sun" Button to put some LEDs On and Hold the "Moon" Button to Reset the LEDs.
The ability to controll the LED Matrix is aviable but currently not enabled and has still to be worked on.
